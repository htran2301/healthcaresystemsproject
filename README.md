Exploratory data visualization project analyzing how remote work impacts mental health, stress, and productivity across industries and global regions using a 5,000-record workforce dataset.
Impact of Remote Work on Mental Health
📌 Project Overview

This project explores how remote, hybrid, and onsite work arrangements impact employee mental health, stress, work–life balance, and productivity across industries and global regions. Using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data visualization, the project uncovers patterns in burnout, anxiety, depression, and productivity outcomes based on workforce characteristics.

### Dataset: Kaggle – Impact of Remote Work on Mental Health (5,000 records)

🎯 Objectives

Understand how different work arrangements relate to mental health conditions

Identify trends in stress and productivity across job roles and regions

Use visual analytics to communicate workforce insights clearly and effectively

🔄 Project Workflow
1. Data Collection

Sourced a global workforce dataset containing:

Work location (remote / hybrid / onsite)

Mental health indicators (burnout, anxiety, depression)

Productivity change

Work–life balance and social isolation

Job roles and geographic regions

2. Data Preparation

Cleaned and standardized column names

Removed duplicate records

Corrected data types

Handled missing values in key variables

Prepared the dataset for exploratory analysis

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Examined distributions of mental health conditions and productivity changes

Compared outcomes across:

Work arrangements

Job roles

Regions

Identified high-risk groups and notable patterns in stress and well-being

4. Data Visualization

Created multiple visualization types to highlight insights:

Violin plots – work hours by industry and work arrangement

Heatmaps – mental health prevalence and feature correlations

Strip plots – stress levels across work locations

Bar charts & sunburst charts – productivity and mental health by role and region

Applied Gestalt design principles (proximity, similarity, symmetry, color harmony) to ensure clarity and readability.

5. Key Insights

Productivity declined in most regions globally, except Africa

Anxiety and burnout were most prevalent in Asia; depression was highest in South America

Remote and onsite workers worked similar hours, challenging assumptions about remote work

Data Scientists showed high stress and mental health incidence but also high productivity

Project Managers, HR, and Marketing experienced the highest stress with decreased productivity

🧠 Tools & Technologies

Python

pandas

matplotlib

seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

📈 Outcome

This project demonstrates how EDA and visual analytics can reveal nuanced workforce patterns and support evidence-based workplace decisions related to employee well-being and productivity.
